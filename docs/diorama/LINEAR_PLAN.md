# Linear plan: Diorama — Town Mode (Clankton)

> Import-ready breakdown for the Linear project. Source designs: [`GAME_BRIDGE.md`](./GAME_BRIDGE.md), [`TOWN_MODE.md`](./TOWN_MODE.md).
> Status: **created in Linear 2026-05-30** — team **Vuhlp** (VUH), project [Diorama — Town Mode (Clankton)](https://linear.app/vuhlp/project/diorama-town-mode-clankton-382ad035cebf). 47 issues **VUH-148 → VUH-194**, 7 milestones, dependency relations wired. Plan codes (F1, T2, …) are prefixed in each issue title for cross-reference.

## Project

- **Name:** Diorama — Town Mode (Clankton)
- **Summary:** Embodied, walk-up-and-talk game surface over AgentRoom. You drive an avatar through a procedurally-generated town that *is* your room, walk up to live agents, and talk to them by text or voice. 2D pixel sprites, single-player, PixiJS-in-WebView. All additive/client-side — one new daemon SSE route, no core/protocol changes.
- **Docs:** link the two design docs above.
- **Milestones:** Phase 0–5 below + a parallel Assets workstream.

### Legend
- **Estimate** = points (Fibonacci 1/2/3/5/8).
- **Labels** (suggested): `daemon`, `diorama-core`, `diorama-town`, `renderer`, `pcg`, `voice`, `ios`, `assets`, `infra`, `test`, `docs`, `spike`.
- **Blocked by** = hard dependency (set as Linear issue relation).

## Phase 0 — Foundation (protocol + core) · prereq for everything

> From `GAME_BRIDGE.md §9/§11`. Town Mode rides on this; build it first.

- **F1 — Add `GET /v1/events/stream` SSE route to agentroomd** `[3]` `daemon`
  Wrap existing `eventCursor` / `listEventsFromCursor`; `?cursor=` query; `text/event-stream` of `RoomEvent`; reuse `/v1/*` bearer auth.
  *AC:* client subscribes with a cursor and receives events as they append; reconnect resumes from last cursor with **no gaps**; unauthorized requests rejected.

- **F2 — Scaffold `@agentroom/diorama-core` package** `[3]` `diorama-core`
  Strict TS, no `any`. Define `WorldSnapshot` / `WorldEntity` / `WorldObject` / `WorldRoom` / `WorldLink` / `WorldEffect`.
  *AC:* package builds + typechecks in the monorepo; types match `GAME_BRIDGE.md §4.2`.

- **F3 — Implement event→world reducer** `[5]` `diorama-core` · *blocked by F2*
  Consume the `RoomEvent` stream → maintain denormalized `WorldSnapshot` (cursor/clock).
  *AC:* feeding a recorded log yields a correct snapshot; idempotent on replay.

- **F4 — Reducer unit tests (events → world invariant)** `[3]` `diorama-core` `test` · *blocked by F3*
  The one stable test worth keeping per `CLAUDE.md`.
  *AC:* covers each domain state/event → snapshot transition; deterministic.

- **F5 — Define `LayoutStrategy` / `SkinMap` / `WorldCommands` / `WorldSource` interfaces** `[2]` `diorama-core` · *blocked by F2*
  *AC:* interfaces compile; documented; match `GAME_BRIDGE.md §4.3–4.5`.

- **F6 — SSE `WorldSource` adapter + command wrappers** `[3]` `diorama-core` · *blocked by F1, F5*
  `subscribe(cursor, onEvent)` over the SSE stream; `WorldCommands` wired to existing REST (`sendInput`/`launch`/`stop`/`delegate`/`post`/`resolveEscalation`).
  *AC:* live room events drive the reducer; a command round-trips to the daemon.

## Phase 1 — Inhabitable town spike

> Goal: walk an avatar around a town built from **real** room data. `TOWN_MODE.md §11.1`.

- **T1 — Scaffold `@agentroom/diorama-pixi` + `@agentroom/diorama-town`** `[2]` `renderer` `diorama-town`
- **T2 — Tile renderer + follow-cam (dead-zone)** `[5]` `renderer`
  *AC:* renders a tile map; camera tracks a target with a dead-zone; 60fps on device.
- **T3 — Static town from live workspaces/agents** `[3]` `diorama-town` `renderer` · *blocked by F6, T2*
  Spike-grade layout: one building per agent, grouped by workspace.
- **T4 — PlayerController + PlayerState (4-dir, joystick + WASD)** `[5]` `diorama-town` `renderer`
  *AC:* avatar moves from keyboard and on-screen joystick; idle/walk anim states.
- **T5 — CollisionGrid + collision resolution** `[3]` `diorama-town` · *blocked by T4*
- **T6 — 🎯 Milestone demo: walk a real-data town on a connected iPhone** `[2]` `spike` · *blocked by T3, T5*
  *AC:* end-to-end loop proven on device per `CLAUDE.md` iOS testing pref.

## Phase 2 — Text dialogue (walk up & talk)

> `TOWN_MODE.md §5.2–5.3, §7, §11.2`. No voice yet.

- **D1 — ProximitySystem + Interactable derivation** `[3]` `diorama-town` · *blocked by T5*
  Nearest interactable within radius; enter/exit diff.
- **D2 — "Press to talk" affordance UI** `[2]` `renderer` · *blocked by D1*
- **D3 — ConversationSession model (phase machine)** `[3]` `diorama-town` · *blocked by F3*
  `idle→listening→sent→acking→thinking→speaking`, bound to one `agentId`.
- **D4 — Inbound wiring: message = speech, terminal = inner monologue** `[3]` `diorama-town` · *blocked by D3*
  `message.posted` → dialogue text; `runtime.output_observed` → optional "their screen" panel (not spoken).
- **D5 — Outbound wiring: `say()` / text field → `sendInput`** `[2]` `diorama-town` · *blocked by D3, F6*
- **D6 — AC-style dialogue box (typewriter, "…" bubble, transcript)** `[5]` `renderer` · *blocked by D4, D5*
- **D7 — Quick-command chips (approve/stop/delegate/show-screen)** `[3]` `renderer` `diorama-town` · *blocked by D5*
- **D8 — Conversation parking + late-reply ping** `[3]` `diorama-town` `renderer` · *blocked by D6*
  Async turn-taking: a reply that arrives after you walk away parks + pings.

---

## Phase 3 — Procedural town layout

> `TOWN_MODE.md §5.5, §6, §11.3`. Deterministic; incremental stability is the hard part.

- **P1 — `ProceduralTownLayout` types + `TownSeed` (stableHash)** `[3]` `pcg` `diorama-town` · *blocked by F5*
  `TownPlan`/`District`/`Lot`/`RoadGraph`; seed from `hash(roomId)` — never a clock/RNG.
- **P2 — District partition (per-workspace, stable order) + lot reservation** `[5]` `pcg` · *blocked by P1*
- **P3 — Incremental-stability lot assignment + tests** `[5]` `pcg` `test` · *blocked by P2*
  Id-keyed, additive, linear-probe. *AC:* adding agent N+1 never moves agents 1..N.
- **P4 — Road routing + plaza + bake CollisionGrid** `[5]` `pcg` · *blocked by P2*
- **P5 — Grid A\* pathfinding (deterministic tie-break)** `[3]` `pcg` `diorama-town` · *blocked by P4*
- **P6 — Handoff/delegation walk animation (carry-item, desk→desk)** `[3]` `renderer` `diorama-town` · *blocked by P5*
- **P7 — Determinism test: same ids+seed → identical TownPlan** `[2]` `pcg` `test` · *blocked by P3, P4*

---

## Phase 4 — Voice layer

> `TOWN_MODE.md §5.4, §11.4`. Edge transform — text stays protocol truth.

- **V1 — `VoiceAdapter` interface (Stt/Tts/VoiceProfile)** `[2]` `voice` `diorama-town`
- **V2 — Web backend: Web Speech STT + SpeechSynthesis TTS** `[5]` `voice` `renderer` · *blocked by V1*
- **V3 — iOS native speech bridge (Swift↔JS in WKWebView)** `[8]` `voice` `ios` · *blocked by V1*
  On-device `SpeechAnalyzer`/`SpeechTranscriber` STT + `AVSpeechSynthesizer` TTS; mic permission; push-to-talk. Privacy: voice never leaves device.
- **V4 — `roleVoices` mapping in `TownSkinMap`** `[2]` `voice` `diorama-town` · *blocked by V1*
- **V5 — Wire voice into ConversationSession (PTT→STT→`say()`; message→TTS)** `[3]` `voice` `diorama-town` · *blocked by V2 or V3, D5*
- **V6 — Mouth-flap sync (2-frame, amplitude-driven)** `[3]` `voice` `renderer` · *blocked by V5*

---

## Phase 5 — Polish & shipping

> `TOWN_MODE.md §7–§11.5`.

- **X1 — Escalation beacons (needs-human/blocked → tall "!")** `[3]` `renderer` `diorama-town` · *blocked by D4*
- **X2 — Off-screen waypoint markers to escalations** `[3]` `renderer` · *blocked by X1*
- **X3 — Overview-camera toggle (walk ⇄ god view, same snapshot)** `[3]` `renderer` · *blocked by T2*
- **X4 — Embodied replay (scrub log, walk town during playback)** `[5]` `diorama-core` `renderer` · *blocked by F3, T6*
- **X5 — Theming/reskin guide (SkinMap/TownSkinMap docs)** `[2]` `docs`
- **X6 — Tauri desktop build wrapping the web bundle** `[3]` `infra` · *blocked by T6*
- **X7 — WKWebView host inside agent-room-ios (bridge token/settings)** `[5]` `ios` `infra` · *blocked by T6*

## Assets workstream (parallel to Phases 1–5)

> Implemented by **Sprite Forge** (`agents/sprite-forge`, agentic-first CLI + skill) — a clean rebuild, **superseding** `dev/game-asset-pipeline`. See **[`ASSETS.md`](./ASSETS.md)** for the A1–A7 → stage mapping, plus `TOWN_MODE.md §9` + `GAME_BRIDGE.md §4.3`. Candidate for the multi-agent generate+QA Workflow. (A1/A2 paths built in the vertical slice; A3/A5/A6 need the `animate` + `bg`/`tileset` stages.)

- **A1 — Style bible: lock palette, resolution, angle, outline, fixed seed** `[3]` `assets`
- **A2 — 7 role character identities** `[5]` `assets` · *blocked by A1*
- **A3 — Per-role animation sets (idle/walk/typing/thinking/alert/wave/celebrate/slump), Aseprite export w/ frame-tags = AnimationState enum** `[8]` `assets` · *blocked by A2*
- **A4 — Player avatar sprite (4-dir walk + idle)** `[3]` `assets` · *blocked by A1*
- **A5 — Exterior town tileset (grass/path/water/trees/fences/buildings/signs) + hand-fix seams** `[8]` `assets` · *blocked by A1*
- **A6 — Object/desk skins (task planned/working/done) + FX (bubble/"!"/confetti/carry-item)** `[5]` `assets` · *blocked by A1*
- **A7 — Dialogue UI art (box, prompt, beacon, waypoint)** `[3]` `assets` · *blocked by A1*

## How to create this in Linear

The `linear-server` MCP is configured for `/Users/jamesvolpe/dev/outofcontext` and currently unauthenticated, so its tools aren't loaded in this workspace. To let me create the project + issues directly, do **one** of:
1. Run Claude Code from `/Users/jamesvolpe/dev/outofcontext`, then `/mcp` → authenticate `linear-server`; or
2. Add the same `linear-server` block to this project's MCP config (`.claude.json` / `/mcp add`) and authenticate.

Once connected, I'll need the target **team** (I can list teams), then I'll create the project, the six milestones, and all 47 issues with estimates + blocking relations in a batch.
